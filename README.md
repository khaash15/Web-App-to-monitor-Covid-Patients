# Web Applcation to monitor Covid Patients
PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Develop an application to monitor the COVID affected patients who was being isolated in their home and monitoring them remotely. The patients are undergoing treatment from their home since there was scarcity for the beds in the hospitals. 

The application should send live monitoring data from the monitoring devices to the doctor portal (please mock the data through some easy source). i.e . If the pulse rate or blood pressure rate, body temperature not in line with the recommendable range should send the alert to the doctors.

Admin modules to manage the doctor profiles patient profiles monitor data.

The applications should have a best UI/ UX platform.
